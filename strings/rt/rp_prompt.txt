Domotan Island, or simply Domotan is the current setting of the Encore Roleplay Server. This island exists within a sprawling fantasy world highlighted by unique, colorful concepts of adventure and lofty writing. This world, called the Goblet of Life was, a thousand years ago, pushed to its brink by an apocalyptic clash between its Gods. In recent history, it has bounded into a new age, the planet - Terra, Gaia or Earth as however one prefers, healing to bring about new mortal lords yet again.

Sovereigns and their kingdoms are many, so too is the breadth of their populace. The Goblet has seen a past of turmoil, but now new sapient kin have taken root within its lands. Fae borne of spirits, demons borne of fire, beasts borne of the soil and men borne of flesh; it is these so-various denizens that you, the player, will become.
